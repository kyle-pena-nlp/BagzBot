## Description

SolSentry is hosted on CloudFlare.
A Telegram bot is configured to invoke a CloudFlare worker via webhook whenever a user interacts with the bot.  The CloudFlare worker delegates actions to Durable Objects for processing and storage.  It interacts with the blockchain via RPC, and uses Jupiter to get swap routes (although it will expand to non-Jupiter as well in the future).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Runtime Dependencies:
* @solana/web3.js
* bs58

TS Dev Dependencies:
* jest
* wrangler
* @cloudflare/workers-types

Python Scripting Dependencies:
* tomli
* tqdm

Please note: Later versions of wrangler (1.19
+) have a broken debugger.  I am intentionally using 1.18 until that's fixed.

### Installing

* pip install the python dev dependencies
* npm install the project

### Running Locally

* The project relies on heavily gitignored files containing API access keys.  Those are team-only and will not be distributed.
* Assuming you have API access keys, you run: `python scripts/start_dev_box.py` to spin up the processes needed to run locally (including simulating CRON jobs that would run on CloudFlare's infrastructure)

### Deploying

* If you are a team member talk to your project lead
