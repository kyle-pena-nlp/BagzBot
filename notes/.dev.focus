1. walk through callbacks / confirms for:
    token address for referral thing DNE
    insufficient lamports / funds

2. automate creation of referral token accounts when a token is looked up.

3. fix menu bugs
    - don't allow final confirm if final quote DNE
    - fix picking the vsToken
    - pull the tokenAddress and vsTokenAddress out of the top level of positionrequest
        (temporarily remove indexing signature to catch uses of these properties)

AM

4. implement proper callback / messaging flow for rpc_interop
    - separate out rpc interop methods from promise chains
    - implement code to optimistically track position and then walk it back if confirmation fails
        and do a final finalized check before attempting to sell
    - implement result of placing order as updated message that receives status updates.

Implement logoURIs b/c it's fun
