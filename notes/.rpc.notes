        We have two async loops (tasks) which, in 'parallel':
            (A) resend the transaction until blockheight exceeded
            (B) check the statuses of the signatures until tx failed or confirmed/finalized

            Solana cookbook, which doesn't have an early out:  https://solanacookbook.com/guides/retrying-transactions.html#customizing-rebroadcast-logic 
            Mango, which isn't blockheight based: https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/mango-ui/blob/b6abfc6c13b71fc17ebbe766f50b8215fa1ec54f/src/utils/send.tsx#L713

        This code is based on ideas from the Solana cookbook (polling blockheight)
        and from ideas in Mango (async tasks).
